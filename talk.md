# Data and code sharing : the neuroimaging situation

* In brain imaging, only few % of data shared
* Highly visible large datasets: the tip of the iceberg
* Resistance to sharing data is very high
* Sharing against authorship
* Most software are free and code is open source (Licenses vary)
* Almost none of the analysis code is shared - highly specific - multiple languages

# Repeatability, Replicability & Reproducibility : the situation in brain mapping

> * Repeatable: in general very poor (within laboratories)
> * Replicability: hardly exist 
> * Method reporting: extremely poor
    - J. Carp, 2012
> * Reproducibility: suspected to be very poor
> * Reproducibility: confirmed to be very poor by some

      structural brain-behavior correlations. Journal of Neuroscience 12,

# Etiology: why is research sick ?

> * The statistical causes
> * The computational causes
> * The sociological / meta causes

# Statistical causes of irreproducibility

> * Ionnadis 2005
> * Small N/power problem: Button et al., 2012
> * P-hacking: Simmons et al. 2011, Simmonshon et al., 2014 
> * File drawer problem: emmergence of complex H0/H1


# Computational causes of irreproducibility

> * Meta data capture and curation (parameters and process of data generation)
> * Associated data capture and curation 
> * Computational environment packaging not used enough (cf Neurodebian)
> * Some specific situations (PI protection, large computing power needed, etc)

# Sociological causes

## Reward system 

> * Highly competitive environment
> * The reward system: the high impact factor journal paper

## Consequences

> * keep any competitive advantage
> * At the detriment of 
    - economy
    - science
    - ethic 

# The incentive problem 

> * Incentives seems to work in the short run, it is a strategy that ultimately fails and even does lasting harm.
> * People actually do inferior work when they are enticed with money, grades, or other incentives
> * We lost some of the principles on which our work should be based


# Punish by reward

# What are the solutions 

## Learning the right computing and statistical tools: 

>    - How can I check my code ? How can I go back to a certain state ? (learn git/mercurial, learn git Annex or others)
>    - How can others check my analyses? Learn the emerging social open science frameworks
>    - Statistical issues
>    - Learn "one layer below" (A. Martelli)

## Remind ourselves of what is our job
